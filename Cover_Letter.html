    <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
      <p>To Whom It May Concern:
        My name is Zachary Sweet, and I am currently a sophomore at Aquinas College.  I am working towards a degree in Management Information Systems and I am writing to inquire about the internship you have available.

        As a sophomore at Aquinas College, I have taken courses in Python, C#, JavaScript, HTML/PHP, and SQL.  I have a strong fundamental knowledge in these disciplines and I am extremely interested in programming and development.  I am looking for an internship that will expand my knowledge in the programming area and allow me to contribute to the success of your company.  

      Currently, I hold a 3.86 GPA and have been on the Deanâ€™s List.  I have strong communication, problem solving, time management and leadership skills.  Also, I have the ability to work with small and large groups of people to achieve a common goal or desired result.

      I would be delighted to have a chance to personally interview with you.  I can be reached at 734-664-0807.  I look forward to speaking with you and being part of the team.
    </p>

    <p>Sincerely,
      <br>
